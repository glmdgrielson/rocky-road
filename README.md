# Rocky Road

This is an attempt to learn Godot by crafting a Mega Man style game. I have no
idea what I'm doing, and help is much appreciated.

## TODO

(Note: this list is subject to change as I figure out what I need to do.)

- [ ] Add Mega Man animations
- [ ] Make Mega Man move
- [ ] Make Mega Man move _accurately_
- [ ] Script Mega Buster
- [ ] Make a dummy level
- [ ] Code up screen transitions
